To address your request, let's break down the tasks and integrate them into your component:

Ensure Text Display: We need to make sure that the scramble text in the about section is displaying correctly.

Add Additional Animations:


jsx
Copy code
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import gsap from 'gsap';

function App() {
  // ... your existing useRef and useState declarations ...

  useEffect(() => {
    // ... your existing parallax effect logic ...

    if (activeContent === 'about') {
      // Animate h1 out
      gsap.to(h1Ref.current, {
        y: 100,
        scale: 0,
        autoAlpha: 0,
        duration: 1,
      });

      // Animate about text in
      gsap.from(aboutTextRef.current, {
        y: -100,
        autoAlpha: 0,
        duration: 1,
        delay: 1,
        onStart: () => {
          // Assuming ScrambleText is correctly set up
          // Replace with your actual scramble text logic
        },
      });

      // Animate buildings
      const buildings = parallaxRef.current.querySelectorAll('.left-img, .middle, .right-img');
      gsap.to(buildings, {
        scale: 0.8, // Make smaller
        x: (index) => (index - 1) * 50, // Move to sides, adjust as needed
        duration: 1,
        delay: 1.2,
      });
    }
  }, [activeContent]);

  // ... rest of your component ...

  return (
    // ... your existing JSX ...
  );
}

export default App;
Key Points:

Make sure the aboutTextRef is correctly referenced in the JSX for the scramble text.
The gsap.to(buildings, {...}) will target the left, middle, and right building images to scale them down and move them to the sides. Adjust the scale value and x-axis movement (x: (index) => (index - 1) * 50) as needed to achieve the desired effect.
If the ScrambleText logic is not yet implemented, you'll need to add the appropriate GSAP plugin and logic. This example assumes you've already set it up.
This setup should allow you to see the text and add the additional

animations when switching to the 'about' section. If you haven't set up the ScrambleText plugin yet, you will need to do so, or use an alternative text animation if the plugin is not available.

Remember, the values used in the animations (like scale, x, duration, delay) are initial estimates. You might need to tweak them to get the exact look and feel you want for your site. Also, ensure that all image elements and the h1 element are correctly referenced with their respective refs and have the necessary CSS styles applied for the animations to take effect.

please complete those lines:
          // Assuming ScrambleText is correctly set up
          // Replace with your actual scramble text logic
provide me more examples what can i use from gasp library to implement in my app 
i know everything is in gasp documentation but please select few animations and also implement in my app with examples.

Certainly! Let's complete the scramble text logic and then explore a few additional animation examples from the GSAP library that you can implement in your app.

1. Completing the Scramble Text Logic
First, let's assume you have access to GSAP's ScrambleTextPlugin (part of the Club GreenSock membership). If you don't have access, you might consider a simple fade-in text effect or another creative animation.

Here's how to complete the scramble text logic:

jsx
Copy code
onStart: () => {
  gsap.to(aboutTextRef.current, {
    duration: 2,
    scrambleText: {
      text: "Your detailed about text goes here",
      chars: "0123456789!@#$%^&*()",
      speed: 0.3,
      revealDelay: 0.5,
    },
  });
},
This code scrambles the text of aboutTextRef.current into the specified text, using the characters in chars for the scramble effect.

2. Additional GSAP Animation Examples
Here are a few examples of animations you can implement using GSAP:

Example 1: Fade In and Slide Up Animation
This animation is great for content that should enter the screen smoothly from the bottom.

jsx
Copy code
// In your component's useEffect or a function
gsap.from('.fade-in-up', {
  y: 30,
  opacity: 0,
  duration: 1,
  stagger: 0.3, // Delay between each element animation
});
In your JSX:

jsx
Copy code
<div className="fade-in-up">Content 1</div>
<div className="fade-in-up">Content 2</div>
<div className="fade-in-up">Content 3</div>
Example 2: Rotating Animation
Ideal for elements that should attract attention by rotating (like a loading icon).

jsx
Copy code
gsap.to('.rotate', {
  rotation: 360,
  duration: 2,
  repeat: -1, // Infinite repeat
  ease: "linear",
});
In your JSX:

jsx
Copy code
<div className="rotate">Rotating Element</div>
Example 3: Bouncing Animation
Perfect for interactive elements like buttons.

jsx
Copy code
gsap.from('.bounce', {
  y: -20,
  repeat: -1,
  repeatDelay: 1,
  yoyo: true,
  ease: "bounce",
});
In your JSX:

jsx
Copy code
<div
.className="bounce">Bouncing Element</div>

#### Example 4: Scaling Animation

This can be used to create a zoom-in effect on images or cards when hovering.

```jsx
// Add this inside a mouse enter event listener
gsap.to('.scale-up', {
  scale: 1.1,
  duration: 0.5,
  ease: "power1.inOut",
});

// And this inside a mouse leave event listener
gsap.to('.scale-up', {
  scale: 1,
  duration: 0.5,
  ease: "power1.inOut",
});
In your JSX:

jsx
Copy code
<div className="scale-up">Scalable Content</div>
Example 5: Elastic Stretch Animation
This can give a playful stretch effect to elements, like buttons or icons.

jsx
Copy code
gsap.from('.elastic', {
  scaleX: 1.5,
  scaleY: 0.7,
  duration: 1.5,
  repeat: -1,
  yoyo:
true,
ease: "elastic.inOut(1, 0.3)",
});

Copy code

In your JSX:

```jsx
<div className="elastic">Elastic Element</div>
Integrating These Animations in Your App
You can integrate these animations into various parts of your application depending on the user interaction or lifecycle events. For instance, you could use the fade-in and slide-up animation (fade-in-up) for elements that appear when a new page section is selected.

To integrate these animations, add the respective class names to the elements you want to animate in your JSX. Then, trigger the animations using GSAP in the appropriate useEffect or event handlers.

Here's an example of how you could integrate the fade-in and slide-up animation when the about section is active:

jsx
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeContent === 'about') {
    gsap.from('.fade-in-up', {
      y: 30,
      opacity: 0,
      duration: 1,
      stagger: 0.3,
    });
  }
  // ... other animations based on activeContent ...
}, [activeContent]);
And in your JSX:

jsx
Copy code
{activeContent === 'about' && (
  <>
    <div className="fade-in-up">About Content 1</div>
    <div className="fade-in-up">About Content 2</div>
    <div className="fade-in-up">About Content 3</div>
  </>
)}
Remember to tailor these animations to fit the context and design of your application. Each animation can be adjusted in terms of duration, delay, ease, and other properties to match the look and feel you desire.


Certainly! Let's explore more animation ideas and provide an example of how to modify the size of the .left, .right, and .middle building images when activeContent is set to 'about'.

Additional Animation Ideas
Idea 1: Path Animation
Animating an element along a path can create an engaging visual effect, suitable for guiding the user's attention or illustrating a journey.

jsx
Copy code
gsap.to('.path-animation', {
  motionPath: {
    path: [{ x: 100, y: 0 }, { x: 200, y: 100 }, { x: 300, y: 0 }],
    autoRotate: true,
  },
  duration: 2,
  ease: "power1.inOut",
});
Idea 2: Text Typing Effect
Simulate a typing effect for text, which can be used for headings or introductions.

jsx
Copy code
// Assuming each letter is wrapped in a span
gsap.fromTo('.typing-effect span', 
  { opacity: 0 },
  { opacity: 1, delay: index => index * 0.1, stagger: 0.1 }
);
Idea 3: Flip Animation
Create a flip animation for cards or images, which can be triggered on hover or click.

jsx
Copy code
gsap.to('.flip-animation', {
  rotationY: 180,
  transformOrigin: "center",
  duration: 1,
  ease: "power2.inOut",
});
Modifying Building Size in 'About' Section
To modify the size of the .left, .right, and .middle building images when activeContent is 'about', you can use GSAP to scale them down and optionally reposition them to create a more dynamic layout.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to implement this:

jsx
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeContent === 'about') {
    // Scale down and reposition buildings
    gsap.to('.left', { scale: 0.8, x: -50, duration: 1 });
    gsap.to('.middle', { scale: 0.8, y: 30, duration: 1 });
    gsap.to('.right', { scale: 0.8, x: 50, duration: 1 });

    // ... other animations ...
  }
}, [activeContent]);
In this setup:

The .left image is scaled down to 80% of its original size and moved 50 pixels to the left.
The .middle image is also scaled down to 80% and slightly moved downwards by 30 pixels.
The .right image is scaled down and moved 50 pixels to the right.
These animations create a sense of space and focus on the 'about' content. You can adjust the scale, `

x, y, and duration` properties to achieve the desired visual effect and ensure that it fits well within your layout.

Integrating These Animations
To integrate these animations into your application, assign the appropriate class names (like .left, .right, .middle, .path-animation, etc.) to the elements in your JSX. Then, trigger the animations in the useEffect hook or event handlers based on the activeContent state or other user interactions.

Here's a brief example of how the JSX might look with these class names:

jsx
Copy code
{activeContent === 'home' && (
  <>
    <img src='img/left.png' alt='left'
className='parallax left' data-speedx='0.03' data-speedy='0.03' />
<img src='img/middle.png' alt='middle' className='parallax middle' data-speedx='0.08' data-speedy='0.08' />
<img src='img/right.png' alt='right' className='parallax right' data-speedx='0.03' data-speedy='0.03' />
{/* ... other elements ... */}
</>
)}
